This project involves extracting sales data from a MySQL database (classicmodels) into Power BI for comprehensive analysis. The key steps include data extraction, formatting, modeling, and designing dashboards and reports.

## Key Steps

### Data Extraction and Formatting:

- Connected Power BI to MySQL using the MySQL connector.
- Loaded tables after checking for duplicates, column names, null values, and ensuring data consistency.

### Data Modeling:

- Transformed Snowflake schema into a Star schema for seamless calculation and presentation.
- Merged necessary tables and established relationships in the data model.

### Designing Dashboards and Reports:

- Created KPIs and charts in Power BI for insightful analysis.
- Analyzed top customers, countries, and employees for strategic decision-making.
- Developed charts for inventory management to optimize business performance.

### Defining Questions for Sales Report

1. Which classic cars are the top-selling models?
2. Who are the top customers in terms of sales revenue?
3. Which regions are performing best/worst in terms of sales?
4. What is the current inventory status of each car model?
5. Are there any issues with stock levels (overstock, understock)?
