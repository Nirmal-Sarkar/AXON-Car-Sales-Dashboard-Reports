# AXON-Car-Sales-Dashboard-Reports

In today's competitive market, effective data management and analysis are crucial for the success of any business. For Axon, a retailer specializing in classic cars, the ability to efficiently manage and analyze sales data is essential for informed decision-making and strategic planning. Currently, Axon is facing significant challenges in this area: the sales team struggles to interpret scattered data, and the lack of a centralized system prevents the management from obtaining accurate and up-to-date sales reports. This has a direct impact on the companyâ€™s ability to make timely and effective business decisions.

To address these issues, we propose the creation of a comprehensive sales report using Power BI. Power BI is a powerful business analytics tool that enables organizations to visualize their data and share insights across the company. By leveraging Power BI, Axon can centralize its sales data, perform in-depth analysis, and generate interactive reports that provide valuable insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and inventory management.
